    "REST is stand for  (Representational State Transfer)\n",
    "it is an architectural style for designing networked applications, especially web services. It is based on a set of principles that emphasize a stateless, client-server interaction, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources. RESTful APIs (Web APIs following the REST principles) use URLs to represent resources and rely on standard HTTP status codes for communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is stand for (Simple Object Access Protocol) Architecture:\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. It uses XML as its message format and typically operates over the HTTP, SMTP, or other application layer protocols. SOAP messages contain both data and metadata, including information about the message structure and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP messages are often more verbose and complex due to their XML structure, which can result in larger message sizes and slower transmission over the network.\n",
