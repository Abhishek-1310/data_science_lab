    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows efficient retrieval, updating, and management of data. Databases are used to store and manage various types of information, from simple lists to complex data structures. They play a crucial role in modern software applications, enabling data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases and NoSQL databases. Let's differentiate between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL databases are also known as relational databases because they store data in tables with predefined columns and data types. Each row in the table represents a record, and each column represents a specific attribute of that record. SQL databases follow a fixed schema, which means the structure of the database is defined in advance, and all records must adhere to that structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, as the name suggests, do not use SQL for data manipulation. They are non-relational databases designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and are more flexible in terms of schema. NoSQL databases utilize various data models, such as key-value stores, document stores, column-family stores, and graph databases, to store and manage data."

These commands do not manipulate the data itself but rather the structure and organization of the data.\n",
