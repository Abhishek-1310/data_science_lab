    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL, non-relational database management system that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, which are relational and use structured tables with fixed schemas, non-relational databases like MongoDB use collections of documents (usually in JSON-like format, collection is a set of documents) with dynamic schemas. This allows for more flexible and adaptable data models.\n",

    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a category of database management systems that provide an alternative approach to storing and managing data compared to traditional relational databases (SQL databases). In contrast to the structured, tabular data representation used in SQL databases, non-relational databases use various data models, such as key-value pairs, document-based, column-family, or graph-based structures, to organize and store data.\n",

    "Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports replica sets that provide data redundancy and automatic failover, ensuring data durability and high availability even in the event of server failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horizontal Scaling: MongoDB's sharding feature allows you to distribute data across multiple servers, enabling horizontal scaling for improved performance and capacity.\n",
