    "Flask is a micro web framework for Python, designed to make it easy to build web applications and APIs. it give decisions and features up to the developer, allowing for greater flexibility and customization. Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalistic design, making it a popular choice for small to medium-sized projects and for developers who prefer a lightweight framework.\n",

    "advantage:\n",
    "Lightweight and Minimalistic: Flask is designed to be simple and minimal, allowing developers to choose the components they need. This makes it easy to start with a basic setup and gradually add features as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask doesn't impose a strict structure or architecture on your project, giving you the freedom to design your application the way you want. This flexibility is especially useful when dealing with unique or unconventional requirements.\n",

    "In Flask, app routing refers to the process of defining URL routes for different parts of your web application. A route is a URL pattern that corresponds to a specific function or view in your Flask application. When a user navigates to a specific URL in their web browser, Flask's routing system matches that URL to the appropriate route, and the associated function is executed to generate and return the appropriate response\n",
    "why do we use app routes\n",
    "URL Mapping: App routes allow you to map URLs to specific functions or views in your application. This makes it easy to organize your application's logic and direct users to the correct content based on the URL they visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "User friendly: App routes contribute to a better user experience by providing clean and user-friendly URLs. Instead of exposing complex or dynamic URLs with query parameters, you can design routes that are easy to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Content: App routes are often used to create dynamic content by accepting variables within the URL. For example, a route like /user/<username> can capture the username from the URL and use it to display personalized user profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs: When building RESTful APIs, app routes define different endpoints for various actions or resources. Each route corresponds to a specific API function, making it easy for clients to interact with your application through HTTP requests.\n",
